NiftyWin Project
(A fork of the p4win client from Perforce Software)

Perforce open sourced the code for p4win a couple of days back, which opens up the
possibility to make some enhancements to the application to bring it inline with
the new features that have been deployed after the product was discontinued, features
like the streams and shelving. The original release for the open source project can be
found here: https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-p4win
