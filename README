NiftyWin Project
(A fork of the p4win client from Perforce Software)

Perforce open sourced the code for p4win a couple of days back, which opens up the
possibility to make some enhancements to the application to bring it inline with
the new features that have been deployed after the product was discontinued, features
like the streams and shelving. The original release for the open source project can be
found here: https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-p4win

As a side note, since there are no installers involved in this, just raw executables
and dlls, the best way to install it would be to simply grab the installer of the last
known version of p4v and then copy the following files from the zipfile into the same
directory. This works even if you have 64 bit p4v. You need to do this, since much of
the functionality in p4win checks for the existence of certain executables to enable
some functionality (e.g. timelapse view). I myself simply unzip the project executables
(p4win.exe etc) into c:\program files\perforce on my 64 bit win7 machine and it works
great.

Also, if you grab the precompiled executables from this site, you might need the correct
visual studio runtime libraries (VS2013), which I believe are these:
