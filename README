NiftyWin Project
(A fork of the p4win client from Perforce Software)

Perforce open sourced the code for p4win a couple of days back, which opens up the
possibility to make some enhancements to the application to bring it inline with
the new features that have been deployed after the product was discontinued, features
like the streams and shelving. The original release for the open source project can be
found here: https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-p4win

As a side note, since there are no installers involved in this, just raw executables
and dlls, the best way to install it would be to simply grab the installer of the last
known version of p4win and then copy the files over manually. You can find the downloads
in the peforce ftp site for now:

http://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r08.1/bin.ntx86/p4winst.exe

Also, if you grab the precompiled executables from this site, you might need the correct
visual studio runtime libraries, which I believe are these:

If in doubt, the binaries should compile fine with Visual Studio 2013 Community edition, 
you are going to need the MFC addon libraries here:
