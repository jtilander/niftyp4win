ContextMenuRules.txt

The following rules apply to menues for all list views based on CP4ListView.  
The context menues should be consistent from one view to the next.  The command
sequence is as follows:

New
Edit
Describe
Delete
-Separator-
Special Action 1
Special Action 2
.....   Action n
-Separator-
Refresh

Ideally, the main window menu will be structured in a similar manner for any
commands that involve these views.
